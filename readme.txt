The following program was written in PyCharm for 2802ICT to run several AI algorithms in Rush Hour.
Input:
The program should be run from the main.py file with two input arguments including the input file (rh.txt) and the maximal time (in ms).
For example: python main.py rh.txt 90000
Output:
Due to the visual nature of the program (utilising turtle), you can run a given problem with the solve button (or by pressing 'S').
This will show each problems goal state, solution sequence, time elapsed, path cost, and nodes traversed underneath the relative board.
Most of these statistics will also be printed to the terminal for ease (note that each algorithm will print 'success' upon finding a goal state).
Iterating through the problems can be achieved by clicking the arrow buttons, or utilising the arrow keys.
Alternatively, you can run all programs consecutively with the run all button (or by pressing 'R')
Although this does not provide much of a visual depiction other than providing notice that its progressing through each problem -
this prints out the relative information for each problem to the out.txt file
